# Project_LB_HTML_June_2021
HTML CSS and JS, HR portal

Why are we doing this?
To create a HR application which contains employee information.

How I expected the challenge to go?
I was apprehensive as linking CSS HTML and JS was daunting as I have had little experience with these.

What went well?
I found the JavaScript easy to get along with as I have had experience with other programming languages.

What didn't go as planned?
Initially struggled with getting the CSS sheet to work with HTML. I didnâ€™t get bootstrap to work which was a shame as that looked interesting.

Possible improvements for the future?
I would like to workout how to use bootstrap to allow me to create very stylised sheets.
